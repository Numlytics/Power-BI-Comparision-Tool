# Power-BI-File-Comparision-Tool

## Problem Statement

This is a Power BI file designed to compare two Power BI files. By taking the file paths of two Power BI files as parameters, the script will analyze and display the differences between them, making it easier to track changes and updates.


### Steps to be followed 

- Step 1 : Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
- Step 2 :  Change the parameter in this pbix file for "First File" and "Second File" to the entire file path including the name of your pbix file (parameters can be found in the ribbon under Home/Edit Queries/Edit Parameters). For example, if your pbix file is saved in your C drive and is named "My Report", then the value for this parameter should be "C:\My Report.pbix".


- Step 3 : Click the "Apply Changes" button.
- Step 4 : When you make changes to your pbix file, save the pbix file and re-do steps 1 and 2 to reflect your changes.
